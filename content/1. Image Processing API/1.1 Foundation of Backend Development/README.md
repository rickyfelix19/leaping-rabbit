## Introduction to Backend Development with Node.js

A Backend Consists of Three Parts:

    The server: the computing resource that listens to requests from the frontend
    The application: code that runs on the server to process requests and return responses
    The database: the part of the backend that is responsible for storing and organizing data

The backend is responsible for processing the requests that come into the app and managing its data. That can mean different things for different apps. In a simple single-page application, the backend may only be needed to host the website. In other cases, the backend is also used to store, organize, and serve data. The backend also plays an important role in authentication, security, and scalability to ensure that the system has the capacity to handle all of the incoming requests.

## Backend Development Stakeholders

Stakeholders in development teams include team leads that typically make service level architecture decisions, a quality assurance team that will likely work with you with testing the application, and a product owner or application manager that will make the higher level decisions and ensure that the application maintains a cohesive structure between services. Other stakeholders are management and owners above them that may be from marketing or engineering. Last and probably the most important are the customers and users who rely on their application to work as expected.

<!-- Backend Stakeholders -->

As a developer, you are also an important stakeholder. By learning how to do backend development with Node.js, you open yourself up to being able to work across an entire stack with just JavaScript.

## History of Backend Development

- Scripting languages first appeared in the 1990s
- The LAMP stack (standing for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) was introduced in 1998
- In 2009, Node.js was created as a javascript runtime that could be used server-side
- In 2012, Microsoft introduced TypeScript to correct Typing issues with JavaScript and reduce typing errors
