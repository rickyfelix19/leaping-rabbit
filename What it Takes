What it Takes

Completing a Udacity program takes perseverance and dedication, but the rewards outweigh the challenges. 
Throughout your program, you will develop and demonstrate specific skills that will serve you for a lifetime. 
Congratulations on taking the first step towards developing the skills you need to power your career through tech education!

The videos, text lessons, and quizzes you encounter in the classroom are optional but recommended. 
The project at the end of this course will test your ability to apply the skills and strategies you have learned in the classroom to real-world problems. 
It will also provide tangible outputs you can use to demonstrate your skills for current and future employers.

The project is designed to be challenging. Many students initially struggle, but with a little grit, they are able to learn from their mistakes and build their skills. 
Data from nearly 100,000 Udacity graduates show that commitment and persistence are the highest predictors of whether or not a student will graduate.

At some point, nearly every student will get stuck on a new concept or skill, and doubt may set in. 
Don’t panic. Don’t quit. Be patient, and work through the problem. 
Remember that you are not alone and the problem that you are encountering is likely one that many others have experienced as well. 
Whether you are stuck or simply looking for encouragement, you’ll find Udacity Mentors and students there to help.
